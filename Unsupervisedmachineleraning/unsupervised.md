Unsupervised learning means when we give data to machine as input without label then machine Organize data into cluster of similar items  like shape,size...
what is clusters ?
In streaming where machine find the patterns  and clusters data
**clustering mean similar chijo(data mai) ek sathh kar dena bina labeling use kiye hue. means no output given to the models 
means similar data points ko group kar dega 

**difference between supervised and unsupervised learnings
supervised-models know the question and answers ,labels hoga
unsupervised-models know only questions,raw data mai patterns find karega and then answers karega 

what is centrid?
A centroid is the geometric center or "center of mass" of a two-dimensional shape or three-dimensional solid, representing the balance point of the object
maann lo age wise spending to hame pata lagne ki 30 saal k e bache kitne kharch karneg tab ham centroid use karnge

what is mean ?
jab hame average pata lagna  ho

Centroid ek average point hota hai jo group/cluster ka center represent karta hai. ML me ye mostly unsupervised learning (clustering) aur distance-based classification me use hota hai.

2... Distance (Ecludian)
Ek Person dusre person se kitna dur hai means to find the similarty
example used in dating app,use in outliar etc

3..Variance and spread 
Variane ka use karte hai data spreading ko pata lagne mai
